# 3n_non_sense
3n calculator to stop the loop at the amount of times it takes to reach a number before it thus be known to be finite.  It also uses a math librrary to handle larger integers. Records results in a text file and a small ml program to use that data to guess the steps to a finite number for any given integer. I have a newer one I seperated out the computations and cache numbers reached during the calculation adding numbers above the current as known finite numbers, but that breaks the GUI and
machine learning aspect to it.  Though if youre a huge math nerd I can send that too.
